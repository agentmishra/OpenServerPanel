sst_dump --file=<data_dir_OR_sst_file> [--command=check|scan|raw|recompress]
    --file=<data_dir_OR_sst_file>
      Path to SST file or directory containing SST files

    --env_uri=<uri of underlying Env>
      URI of underlying Env

    --command=check|scan|raw|verify
        check: Iterate over entries in files but don't print anything except if an error is encountered (default command)
        scan: Iterate over entries in files and print them to screen
        raw: Dump all the table contents to <file_name>_dump.txt
        verify: Iterate all the blocks in files verifying checksum to detect possible corruption but don't print anything except if a corruption is encountered
        recompress: reports the SST file size if recompressed with different
                    compression types

    --output_hex
      Can be combined with scan command to print the keys and values in Hex

    --decode_blob_index
      Decode blob indexes and print them in a human-readable format during scans.

    --from=<user_key>
      Key to start reading from when executing check|scan

    --to=<user_key>
      Key to stop reading at when executing check|scan

    --prefix=<user_key>
      Returns all keys with this prefix when executing check|scan
      Cannot be used in conjunction with --from

    --read_num=<num>
      Maximum number of entries to read when executing check|scan

    --verify_checksum
      Verify file checksum when executing check|scan

    --input_key_hex
      Can be combined with --from and --to to indicate that these values are encoded in Hex

    --show_properties
      Print table properties after iterating over the file when executing
      check|scan|raw

    --set_block_size=<block_size>
      Can be combined with --command=recompress to set the block size that will
      be used when trying different compression algorithms

    --compression_types=<comma-separated list of CompressionType members, e.g.,
      kSnappyCompression>
      Can be combined with --command=recompress to run recompression for this
      list of compression types

    --parse_internal_key=<0xKEY>
      Convenience option to parse an internal key on the command line. Dumps the
      internal key in hex format {'key' @ SN: type}
