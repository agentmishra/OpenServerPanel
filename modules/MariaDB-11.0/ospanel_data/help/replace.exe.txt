This program replaces strings in files or from stdin to stdout.
It accepts a list of from-string/to-string pairs and replaces
each occurrence of a from-string with the corresponding to-string.
The first occurrence of a found string is matched. If there is
more than one possibility for the string to replace, longer
matches are preferred before shorter matches.

A from-string can contain these special characters:
  \^      Match start of line.
  \$      Match end of line.
  \b      Match space-character, start of line or end of line.
          For a end \b the next replace starts locking at the end
          space-character. A \b alone in a string matches only a
          space-character.
