Dumps a MariaDB binary log in a format usable for viewing or for piping to
the mysql command line client.

Usage: mariadb-binlog.exe [options] log-files

Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
C:\Windows\my.ini C:\Windows\my.cnf C:\my.ini C:\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-11.0\data\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-11.0\data\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-11.0\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-11.0\my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysqlbinlog mariadb-binlog client client-server client-mariadb
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults          Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults             Don't read default options from any option file.
The following specify which files/extra groups are read (specified before remaining options):
--defaults-file=#         Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=#   Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=# Additionally read default groups with # appended as a suffix.

  -?, --help          Display this help and exit.
  --base64-output=name 
                      Determine when the output statements should be
                      base64-encoded BINLOG statements: ‘never’ neither
                      prints base64 encodings nor verbose event data, and will
                      exit on error if a row-based event is found.
                      'decode-rows' decodes row events into commented SQL
                      statements if the --verbose option is also given.
                      ‘auto’ outputs base64 encoded entries for row-based
                      and format description events. If no option is given at
                      all, the default is ‘auto', and is consequently the
                      only option that should be used when row-format events
                      are processed for re-execution.
  --character-sets-dir=name 
                      Directory for character set files.
  -d, --database=name List entries for just this database (local log only).
  --debug-check       Check memory and open file usage at exit .
  --debug-info        Print some debug info at exit.
  --default-auth=name Default authentication client-side plugin to use.
  -D, --disable-log-bin 
                      Disable binary log. This is useful, if you enabled
                      --to-last-log and are sending the output to the same
                      MariaDB server. This way you could avoid an endless loop.
                      You would also like to use it when restoring after a
                      crash to avoid duplication of the statements you already
                      have. NOTE: you will need a SUPER privilege to use this
                      option.
  -B, --flashback     Flashback feature can rollback you committed data to a
                      special time point.
  -F, --force-if-open Force if binlog was not closed properly.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-force-if-open to disable.)
  -f, --force-read    Force reading unknown binlog events.
  -H, --hexdump       Augment output with hexadecimal and ASCII event dump.
  -h, --host=name     Get the binlog from server.
  -l, --local-load=name 
                      Prepare local temporary files for LOAD DATA INFILE in the
                      specified directory.
  -o, --offset=#      Skip the first N entries.
  -p, --password[=name] 
                      Password to connect to remote server.
  --plugin-dir=name   Directory for client-side plugins.
  -P, --port=#        Port number to use for connection or 0 for default to, in
                      order of preference, my.cnf, $MYSQL_TCP_PORT,
                      /etc/services, built-in default (3306).
  --protocol=name     The protocol to use for connection (tcp, socket, pipe).
  -R, --read-from-remote-server 
                      Read binary logs from a MariaDB server.
  --raw               Requires -R. Output raw binlog data instead of SQL
                      statements. Output files named after server logs.
  -r, --result-file=name 
                      Direct output to a given file. With --raw this is a
                      prefix for the file names.
  --print-row-count   Print row counts for each row events
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-print-row-count to disable.)
  --print-row-event-positions 
                      Print row event positions
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-print-row-event-positions to disable.)
  --ignore-domain-ids=name 
                      A list of positive integers, separated by commas, that
                      form a blacklist of domain ids. Any log event with a GTID
                      that originates from a domain id specified in this list
                      is hidden. Cannot be used with --do-domain-ids. When used
                      with --(ignore|do)-server-ids, the result is the
                      intersection between the two datasets.
  --do-domain-ids=name 
                      A list of positive integers, separated by commas, that
                      form a whitelist of domain ids. Any log event with a GTID
                      that originates from a domain id specified in this list
                      is displayed. Cannot be used with --ignore-domain-ids.
                      When used with --(ignore|do)-server-ids, the result is
                      the intersection between the two datasets.
  --ignore-server-ids=name 
                      A list of positive integers, separated by commas, that
                      form a blacklist of server ids. Any log event originating
                      from a server id specified in this list is hidden. Cannot
                      be used with --do-server-ids. When used with
                      --(ignore|do)-domain-ids, the result is the intersection
                      between the two datasets.
  --do-server-ids=name 
                      A list of positive integers, separated by commas, that
                      form a whitelist of server ids. Any log event originating
                      from a server id specified in this list is displayed.
                      Cannot be used with --ignore-server-ids. When used with
                      --(ignore|do)-domain-ids, the result is the intersection
                      between the two datasets. Alias for --server-id.
  --server-id=name    Extract only binlog entries created by the server having
                      the given id. Alias for --do-server-ids.
  --set-charset=name  Add 'SET NAMES character_set' to the output.
  -s, --short-form    Just show regular queries: no extra info, no row-based
                      events and no row counts. This is mainly for testing
                      only, and should not be used to feed to the MariaDB
                      server. If you want to just suppress base64-output, you
                      can instead use --base64-output=never
  -S, --socket=name   The socket file to use for connection.
  --ssl               Enable SSL for connection (automatically enabled with
                      other flags).
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ssl to disable.)
  --ssl-ca=name       CA file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies
                      --ssl).
  --ssl-capath=name   CA directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
  --ssl-cert=name     X509 cert in PEM format (implies --ssl).
  --ssl-cipher=name   SSL cipher to use (implies --ssl).
  --ssl-key=name      X509 key in PEM format (implies --ssl).
  --ssl-crl=name      Certificate revocation list (implies --ssl).
  --ssl-crlpath=name  Certificate revocation list path (implies --ssl).
  --tls-version=name  TLS protocol version for secure connection.
  --ssl-verify-server-cert 
                      Verify server's "Common Name" in its cert against
                      hostname used when connecting. This option is disabled by
                      default.
  --start-datetime=name 
                      Start reading the binlog at first event having a datetime
                      equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be
                      a date and time in the local time zone, in any format
                      accepted by the MariaDB server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP
                      types, for example: 2004-12-25 11:25:56 (you should
                      probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly).
  -j, --start-position=name 
                      Start reading the binlog at this position. Type can
                      either be a positive integer or a GTID list. When using a
                      positive integer, the value only applies to the first
                      binlog passed on the command line. In GTID mode, multiple
                      GTIDs can be passed as a comma separated list, where each
                      must have a unique domain id. The list represents the
                      gtid binlog state that the client (another "replica"
                      server) is aware of. Therefore, each GTID is exclusive;
                      only events after a given sequence number will be printed
                      to allow users to receive events after their current
                      state.
  --gtid-strict-mode  Process binlog according to gtid-strict-mode
                      specification. The start, stop positions are verified to
                      satisfy  start < stop comparison condition. Sequence
                      numbers of any gtid domain must comprise monotically
                      growing sequence
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-gtid-strict-mode to disable.)
  --stop-datetime=name 
                      Stop reading the binlog at first event having a datetime
                      equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be
                      a date and time in the local time zone, in any format
                      accepted by the MariaDB server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP
                      types, for example: 2004-12-25 11:25:56 (you should
                      probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly).
  --stop-never        Wait for more data from the server instead of stopping at
                      the end of the last log. Implies --to-last-log.
  --stop-never-slave-server-id=# 
                      The slave server_id used for --read-from-remote-server
                      --stop-never.
  --stop-position=name 
                      Stop reading the binlog at this position. Type can either
                      be a positive integer or a GTID list. When using a
                      positive integer, the value only applies to the last
                      binlog passed on the command line. In GTID mode, multiple
                      GTIDs can be passed as a comma separated list, where each
                      must have a unique domain id. Each GTID is inclusive;
                      only events up to the given sequence numbers are printed.
  -T, --table=name    List entries for just this table (affects only row
                      events).
  -t, --to-last-log   Requires -R. Will not stop at the end of the requested
                      binlog but rather continue printing until the end of the
                      last binlog of the MariaDB server. If you send the output
                      to the same MariaDB server, that may lead to an endless
                      loop.
  -u, --user=name     Connect to the remote server as username.
  -v, --verbose       Reconstruct SQL statements out of row events. -v -v adds
                      comments on column data types. -v -v -v adds diagnostic
                      warnings about event integrity before program exit.
  -V, --version       Print version and exit.
  --open-files-limit=# 
                      Used to reserve file descriptors for use by this program.
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. This value must be a multiple of 256.
  -c, --verify-binlog-checksum 
                      Verify binlog event checksums.
  --rewrite-db=name   Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example: rewrite-db='from->to'.
  --skip-annotate-row-events 
                      Don't print Annotate_rows events stored in the binary
                      log.
  --print-table-metadata 
                      Print metadata stored in Table_map_log_event
