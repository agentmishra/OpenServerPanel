myisamlog.exe from 11.0.4-MariaDB, client 1.4 for Win64 (AMD64)
By Monty, for your professional use

Write info about whats in a MyISAM log file.
If no file name is given myisam.log is used

Usage: myisamlog.exe [-?iruvDIV] [-c #] [-f #] [-F filepath/] [-o #] [-R file recordpos] [-w write_file] [log-filename [table ...]] 

Options: -? or -I "Info"     -V "version"   -c "do only # commands"
         -f "max open files" -F "filepath"  -i "extra info"
         -o "offset"         -p # "remove # components from path"
         -r "recover"        -R "file recordposition"
         -u "update"         -v "verbose"   -w "write file"
         -D "myisam compiled with DBUG"   -P "processes"

One can give a second and a third '-v' for more verbose.
Normally one does a update (-u).
If a recover is done all writes and all possibly updates and deletes is done
and errors are only counted.
If one gives table names as arguments only these tables will be updated
