Usage:  unbound-host [-C configfile] [-vdhr46] [-c class] [-t type]
                     [-y key] [-f keyfile] [-F namedkeyfile] hostname
  Queries the DNS for information.
  The hostname is looked up for IP4, IP6 and mail.
  If an ip-address is given a reverse lookup is done.
  Use the -v option to see DNSSEC security information.
    -t type             what type to look for.
    -c class            what class to look for, if not class IN.
    -y 'keystring'      specify trust anchor, DS or DNSKEY, like
                        -y 'example.com DS 31560 5 1 1CFED8478...'
    -D                  DNSSEC enable with default root anchor
                        from C:\Program Files\Unbound\root.key
    -f keyfile          read trust anchors from file, with lines as -y.
    -F keyfile          read named.conf-style trust anchors.
    -C config           use the specified unbound.conf (none read by default)
                        pass as first argument if you want to override some
                        options with further arguments
    -r                  read forwarder information from /etc/resolv.conf
                        breaks validation if the forwarder does not do DNSSEC.
    -v                  be more verbose, shows nodata and security.
    -d                  debug, traces the action, -d -d shows more.
    -4                  use ipv4 network, avoid ipv6.
    -6                  use ipv6 network, avoid ipv4.
    -h                  show this usage help.
